# Malagasy Passport
You can check the final app [here](https://malagasypassport.ml).

# How to run it locally
Make sure you have :
- a **linux terminal** such as [git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for example
- [**node**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [**serve**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) library
## Step 1 : clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jadynekena/passeportgasy
```

## Step 2 : run the server
```
cd passeportgasy
serve
```
**As for now, this project is in Vanilla JS. Later on, the serve might use react server.**

## Step 3 : preview the app
Just go to `localhost:3000` and the app must be available.

# Dependencies
- `jquery`, `threeJS`, `gioJS` : for globe animations

# Useful files

- `loadData.js` : the main JS file where everything is handled on first rendering
